What was once an Android native app finds new life in the world of Web development. :)

This project includes a Node.js backend hosting a client app-facing API as well as a web frontend for a 
horizontal directional drilling company named Bison, Inc.
It also houses a mobile app built using the Ionic framework to be used in the creation of billable reports and internal data
collection.
