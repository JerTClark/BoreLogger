##BoreLoggor - an Ionic app
#On the master, in the ionic directory
What was once an Android native app finds **new life** in the world of Web development. :) A simplistic little mobile app built using AngularJS and the Ionic framework. It's used for creating billable reports, but like most things these days, it's obsessed with amassing precious internal corporate data. This data will be analyzed to help ease making those critical decisions on which can often hinge any small businesses' fate.

## Node.js & Mongo
#Coming soon, aka All the empty nonsense
This project is intended to consist of a Node.js backend hosting a client/app-facing API for MongoDB. These features are all on the back-burner while the **Ionic app** is being completed. Plan being the linking of a small, family-owned business to a wealth of Haliburton knowledge via some awesome little (in-development) *web-apps*-- like **CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute)**, **Annular Velocity** (eeew), and **GRP (General Recommendations & Pullback)** calculators. Of course, there will also be a website for people to checkout.
