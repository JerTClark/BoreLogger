#Bore Journal
##Essential Data Collection

From the inception of the Bore Journal, I've intended this as an internal analysis tool.
 - How log did it take us to drill in that last rod?
 - Why did it take that long?
 - What kind of ground was it?
 - How have we fared in certain areas? ie, What does our average time per rod or foot look like?

The mantra that

> Anybody can do it the **easy** way...

just don't cut it.

With adding the **Note** feature to the Bore Journal locates fragment, I can enable a more detailed
report for each job. We now have the **XML** factor working, too, where every thinkable aspect of a
is now rod drilled into the ground is collected, organized and ready for analysis.

The rundown of what data is currently parsable:
 - [x] Date (separated into M, D, and Y)
 - [x] Time (separated into H, M, and S)
 - [x] Notes -- anything worth mentioning
 
The future of **Notes** is to allow for further analysis -- primarily concerned with aspects surrounding
downtime:
 - Where do we suffer the most downtime?
 - What costs are we eating because of it?
 - What actions do these causes of downtime suggest we take to minimize cost?
 - Where do we *really* make the most money?

##Charts
Brainstorming, I'd really love a feature where I can construct a URL and fire it off to Google charts.
Especially after and during jobs of longer duration a good review of how things have been going
sometimes requires more than just a feeling of what's got to be done in order to move on. A chart is
is great for showing data for use internally as well as when answering customers' questions.
