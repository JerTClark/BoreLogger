#Examples
Contains XML, DTD, Schema, and XSLT example documents.

The files pre-included here are examples and **required** for the Enums in the
xml.resources package to work.

Once those packages have been properly configured with file names required
for an actual project, all of these files may be removed or kept for future
reference and unit testing.
